# Arbitrage Bot
A bot for inter-exchange arbitrage that monitors price changes and automatically opens positions in the futures market.

This bot is designed to automate arbitrage trading between two cryptocurrency exchanges. It continuously monitors prices on the first exchange with high volatility and opens corresponding positions on the second exchange with lower volatility when specified conditions are met.
The project works with Binance and OKX exchanges.
